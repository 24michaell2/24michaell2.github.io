    <div class="explain">
      <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; margin-top: -3%;">If you've never faced an online Zelda, consider yourself lucky. Online Zeldas all play the exact same. Neutral B when you approach, down B and side B after running away, and up B as a get out of jail free card. A character who's game is just running away and spamming projectiles is already annoying, but Zelda has so much more than those characters</p>

        <h5 class="movetitle">Neutral Special</h5>
        <div class="zeldaMoves">
        <p>Zelda's neutral B makes her invicible, and punishes approach with 11%. Zelda's gameplay is usually just running away and spamming projectiles
          so approaching her was already very annoying. But now add in her neutral B so that on the off-chance you finally get through the projectiles spam,
          you just end up getting punished for it. Usuallly, you can just time your approach in between the neutral B spam. But online Zeldas just use the online lag
          to their advantage and walls us out with a click of a button. It also doesn't help that it reflects projectiles too. The move truly does everything for online Zelda.

      <h5 class="movetitle">Down Special</h5>
      <div class="zeldaMoves">
        <p>Zelda's game is to just run away and spam projectiles like side B and down B. Out of the two, down B is much worse.
           It does EVERYTHING for her. It hits you on the ledge, it hits you on the platform, it's basically a stage hazard 
           that only affects you and thats going to be activated every chance the Zelda player gets. It's really annoying to
            deal with and straight up impossible for some characters, and requires literally a click of a button</p>

      <h5 class="movetitle">Up Special</h5>
      <div class="zeldaMoves">
        <p>Zelda's Up B is not just a teleport recovery, which are inheritly close to impossible to edgeguard. But if you ever get close to a Zelda,
          Bam, up b away, which has an unbelievable launch distance and kills earlier than a lot of character's smash attacks. The move only adds to Zelda's annoying playstyle.
          Run away, spam projectiles, if you get close, neutral b them away, and when they look like they are at a kill percent, just use Up B and kill em. It also doesn't help that
          with the net code lag of 6 frames, her up b becomes theoretically unreactable.
